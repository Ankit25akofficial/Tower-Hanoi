# Tower-Hanoi
This project is a 2D Tower of Hanoi simulation created using Python's Turtle Graphics. It provides a visual and interactive representation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, where users can select the number of disks and watch an animated solution of the puzzle unfold.


# 2D Tower of Hanoi - Visual Puzzle Solver
This repository contains a 2D simulation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, developed using Python's Turtle Graphics library. It provides an interactive and animated solution to the classic Tower of Hanoi problem.


# Features
Interactive User Input:
Enter the number of disks (1-10).
Select the speed of the animation (1 = slow, 10 = fast).
Realistic and Smooth Animations:
The disk movements are fluid, with realistic acceleration and deceleration (easing effect).
Customizable Visuals:
Pegs are styled with colors, shadows, and borders for a more polished look.
Disks are available in multiple colors and simulate a 3D effect through textures and shading.
Educational Tool:
This project visually demonstrates the recursive solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, making it a great tool for learning.
# üöÄ How It Works
The Tower of Hanoi is a famous puzzle with three rods and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move all disks from the starting rod to the destination rod, following these rules:

üõë Only one disk can be moved at a time.
üîÑ Each move consists of taking the top disk from one rod and placing it on another.
‚öñÔ∏è A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk.
This simulation automatically solves the puzzle and visually shows each step!

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
Each move involves taking the top disk from one rod and placing it on another.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk, never a smaller one.
This simulation automatically solves the puzzle based on user input, displaying each step visually in a 2D environment.
